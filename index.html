<h1>Bryans Past,Present,and Future</h1>

<h2>My Past</h2>

<p> I was born in Greenville South,Carolina on Febuary 11,2003. I have lived in
the United states all my life and never moved to any other country or state in
my life. When I was born, my brothers were the ones who took care of me because
my mom had to work and so did my dad but when our mother came back she took
care of me for the rest of the day until she went back too work which was not
until the next morning. When the weekend came all of us went to go shopping or
go eat somewhere all together we loved to go eat at a Mexican Restaurant or go
eat at a Japanese Restaurant but we all vote on what restaurant we would like
to go eat at. Sometimes we dont vote at all and our parents take us where they
want to eat at.When we finished eating our parents took all of us to the mall
to get all of us a pair of shoes we usually dont get a pair every week only
after a month passes by then we usually get a new pair of shoes. We also go
shopping for clothes and we usually get three pais of clothes each I get
clothes that my parents choose for me.
